## libraries used

Libaries used in this project fall into three categories:

1. Open-Source Code in the Go standard library
2. Open-Source Code in the "eyecuelab/kit" repository that I wrote while working for my previous employer, EyeCueLab.
3. Open-Source Code in Stretchr's open-source "testify" testing/assertion library.
